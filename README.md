# Overview

The Nexus app offers a streamlined experience by seamlessly integrating Outlook, Teams, and the Calendar into its Overview dashboard. This centralised resource hub empowers users to efficiently locate and retrieve resources across multiple Microsoft applications without the need for constant switching between platforms. By consolidating these tools, Nexus aims to enhance productivity and organisational capabilities.

One of the key features of Nexus is its intuitive overview user interface. This interface provides users with a clear and comprehensive view of their mail, teams, meetings, and communications in a single, easy-to-navigate dashboard. By presenting all relevant information in one place, Nexus eliminates the need to jump between different applications, saving valuable time and effort.

To further enhance user experience, Nexus offers grouping functionality. This feature enables users to categorize and filter the available information based on their preferences and priorities. By customizing their view and focusing on specific projects, teams, or tasks, users can maintain a highly focused and tailored approach. This capability ensures that users can quickly access the resources they need without being overwhelmed by unnecessary distractions or irrelevant information.
